# Advent of Code with Bun

A repository for solving Advent of Code with Bun runtime. Generated using [following template](https://github.com/adrianklimek/advent-of-code-bun/generate).

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have installed [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation#installing).
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Create `.env` file based on `.env.example`.
4. (Optional) Set your session token with environment variables to automatically fetch your input. You can obtain the session token from the AoC session cookie.

## Running the Code

To run any solution you have to run the `solve` script. It will create all directories and files for a day, and also it can fetch your input file. Besides that, it watches all the changes you make and shows a result in a terminal.

### Example usage

Command structure:

To run a solution for the first day:

```bash
bun solve 1
```

To run all available solutions:

```bash
bun solve all
```

You can specify optional year as 3rd argument:

```bash
bun solve 1 2024
bun solve all 2024
```

To run tests in watch mode:

```bash
bun test --watch
```

## Structure

For each day a directory in `src` is created with the following structure for specified year:

```bash
ðŸ“‚ 2024
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ 01
    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ 01.ts
    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ 01.test.ts
    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œ example.txt
    â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“œ input.txt
```

## Closing words

Happy coding! ðŸŽ„âœ¨
